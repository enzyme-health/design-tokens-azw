# design-tokens-test
Testing out the transition from the Matisse (GoodRx Design System) to Echelon, our new token-driven design system and component library. The goal of this effort is to be able to create multiple token sets that define core elements, particular overrides for different products, and custom config files to facilitate customer white-labelling.

This token sets are currently being used in Design System figma files (found within the DesignOps Team):
